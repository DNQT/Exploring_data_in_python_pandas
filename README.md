# Exploring data using Python and Pandas
This project consists in exploring data in Python language, using the Jupyter-Notebook and the Pandas library.

In the project the teacher's requests and the python code are written in English, while the project presentation and comments on the codes are in Italian.

The Normalizing university names folder contains files that describe how i normalized university names in the following tables: 'shanghai_most_recent_data', 'times_most_recent_data' and 'world_most_recent_data'. I recommend opening this file once you get to the fourth point of the project.
